# covid-19-self-checker

This project was created by Mahum Syed, using the skills learned from the Girls Who Code Program. I made this self-checker because it is extremely important for us to keep others safe as much as possible and limit the spread of the virus. A simple daily task like this will provide more information about what you can or should do, based on your current state.
